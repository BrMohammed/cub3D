# Cub3d

The goal of cub3d is to make something using raycasting (like [I'm an inline-style link](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) 3D)
but i added a condition , must colect all the cristals to win befor end of time

# Prerequisites

The project runs using the MiniLibX, a simplified version of the Xlib. It can therefore only run in MacOSX, preferably on a computer with a solid CPU !

# How to run it

Using `make` will build the executable.

To run it  run the executable with `./cub3D map.cub`.

# Controls

You can move around the maze with `W` `A` `S` `D`.

You can also rotate the view with the directional arrows `←` and `→`.

You can hide the mouse with `m`

To exit the game, press `ESC` or click the red cross.
